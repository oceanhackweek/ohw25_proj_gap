# gap-filling gridded data

This project worked on getting 2 different approaches to gap-filling of gridded data working: UNet gap-filling model {cite:p}`hong_global_2023` developed by Yifei Hang during summer 2024 and DINCAE (Data-Interpolating Convolutional Auto-Encoder) {cite:p}`Barthetal2020, Barthetal2022`.

We learned a lot of lessons about reproducing (or not reproducing) CNN projects.
